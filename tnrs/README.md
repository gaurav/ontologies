## TNRS Ontology and RDF Data Model

This directory contains a shared ontology for representing the results from Taxonomic Name Resolution Service (TNRS) requests, which also serves as an RDF data model for storing these results in a triple store. 

It was initially created in June 2012 at the first of the [Phylotastic hackathon series](http://phylotastic.org) organized and run by the [Hackathons, Interoperability, Phylogenetics (HIP) Working Group](http://www.evoio.org/wiki/HIP) at [NESCent](http://nescent.org). 

Included here are instance documents (in RDF/XML and quite readable Turtle versions) to serve as examples and also validation of the ontology's use cases. These instance documents are based off of the example on the [TNRS wiki page](http://www.evoio.org/wiki/Phylotastic/TNRS).
