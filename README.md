Ontologies for Phylotastic
==========================

This repository contains ontologies and vocabularies developed for Phylotastic components, such as the treestore, taxonomic name resolution, web service annotatio, and other purposes.

The ontologies or vocabularies maintained here are only a small fraction of those used in Phylotastic. Most have scope and application areas much broader than Phylotastic, and therefore have established homes elsewhere. This includes [CDAO](http://sourceforge.net/projects/cdao) and [MIAPA](http://github.com/miapa/miapa).
